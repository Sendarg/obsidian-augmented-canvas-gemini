# Obsidian Augmented Canvas (Gemini Enhanced)

This is a fork of [obsidian-augmented-canvas](https://github.com/MetaCorp/obsidian-augmented-canvas) by MetaCorp.

This version has been modified to use Google's Gemini models instead of OpenAI's GPT. All other features have been removed to simplify the plugin.

## How to Use

1.  **Install the plugin.** (Manual installation is required for now).
2.  **Get a Gemini API Key:** Obtain your API key from Google AI Studio.
3.  **Configure the Plugin:** Open the plugin settings in Obsidian and enter your Gemini API key.
4.  **Select a Gemini Model:** Choose a Gemini model from the dropdown menu.
5.  **Start Augmenting:** Use the AI features on your canvas notes.
